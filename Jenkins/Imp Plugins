This plugin allows a job to be run after all the immediate downstream jobs have completed. 
In this way, the execution can branch out and perform many steps in parallel, 
and then run a final aggregation step just once after all the parallel work is finished. 
This plugin is useful for creating a diamond shape project dependency. 
This means there is a single parent job that starts several downstream jobs. 
Once those jobs are finished, a single aggregation job runs. 
Unfortunately, more complex interactions are not possible with this plugin.
